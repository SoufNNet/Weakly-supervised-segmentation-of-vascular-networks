# Weakly Supervised Segmentation of Vascular Networks

This project explores **weakly supervised segmentation of vascular networks** with an innovative approach that integrates the **second-order variational model of Black-Zisserman** into the loss function.

## Project Objectives

- Improve the accuracy of vascular network segmentation methods using limited training data.
- Incorporate the second-order variational model into the loss function for better regularization and structural feature representation.

## Information

This project is developed as part of my **Master's Thesis (M2)**.
